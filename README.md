# OneEdit Backend

OnEdit Backend (Formerly known as LiteFileServer.js) is front-end and back-end library that allows javascript apps to store resources (images, text-files, binaries) in the server.
It comes with its own users and units system that allow every user to partition its own space and share it among other users.

Some of the features:

 * REST HTTP API for storing, listing, moving, updating or deleting files.
 * Basic users (register, login, delete, administration )
 * Independent file tree per user
 * Units, users can have several units to store files and share with other users
 * Files can have thumbnail image and metadata

The server side is coded in PHP and comes with useful scripts for administration.

Installing
----------

Check the [install guide](INSTALL.md) to see a step by step process of how to install it in your server.

Usage
----------

Once installed you can include the ```litefileserver.js``` script in your project you must first login:

```javascript
var lfs = LFS.setup("myhost", onReady );
var session = null;

//check to see if the server is available
function onReady()
{
   LFS.login( username, password, onLogin );
}

function onLogin( my_session, err )
{
   if(!my_session)
      throw("error login in:", err);
   session = my_session;
}
```

Once logged you can fetch for files and folders using the session:

```javascript

session.getUnitsAndFolders( function(units) {
  //units contain info about every unit and which folders it has
});

session.getFiles( unit_id, folder, function( files ) {
  //info about the files in that folder
});

```

Check the ```LFS.Session``` class for more info about all the actions you can perform (create folders, units, give privileges, upload files, etc).

Also check the demo in the src folder to see an usage of the system.
